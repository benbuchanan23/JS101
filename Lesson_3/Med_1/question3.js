/*  *************  Question 3  ***************

  Alan wrote the following function, which was intended to return all of the factors of number:

function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];
  do {
    if (number % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(number / divisor);
    }
    divisor -= 1;
  } while (divisor !== 0);
  return factors;
}

  Alyssa noticed that this code would fail when the input is 0 or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can he make this work without using a do/while loop? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];

  while (divisor > 0) {
    if (number % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(number / divisor);
    }
    divisor -= 1;
  }
}

console.log(factors(10));
